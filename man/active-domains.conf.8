.SH NAME
active-domains.conf \- sNow! active domains configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
Provides a list of sNow! domains and the associated roles which define the services provided by each domain.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The active-domains.conf configuration file contains a list of the sNow! domains and its associated role. Each role defines a service or a subset of related services.
The roles are very simple scripts which will automatise the process of deploying a new domain and also reconfigure them based on the parameters available in the main
sNow! configuration file (snow.conf). 
The first column contains the hostname of the domain, the second column contains the role or list or roles associated with the domain.
Each domain can have one or more roles. In case of multiple roles, the roles list MUST be separated with a colon and wihout any space in between. See examples below.
If a domain have multiple roles, each role will be executed in the same order defined in the domains.conf, which will be automatically generated with the "snow init" command.
The current available roles are located in /sNow/snow-tools/etc/roles.d. This document provides information of key roles but all the available roles.
