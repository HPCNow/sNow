During the installation process one or two users have been created:
* The sNow! user (snow) is the admin user which will be able to install scientific applications and to escalate to root privileges.  
* [optional] The HPCNow! user (hpcnow) can also escalate to root privileges and is meant to be used for remote administration and support.
{% include note.html content="By default, the only way to access the system as the sNow! or HPCNow! user is by using the SSH key located in the userâ€™s home directory. Note that at this point, those users do not have a password. If you want to enable password access, you will need to setup a password first." %}
## Access as sNow! user with the SSH key
You will need to transfer a copy of the snow user SSH key to your desktop computer. You can copy this file to a pendrive or transfer the file from the sNow! server through SCP or any other file transfer mechanism.
## Allow access for professional remote administration and support
You will need to provide the HPCNow! user name and the SSH key or password to the remote administration engineer.
